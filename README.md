# LinkPageForRSS

Lightweight PHP Webpage to display Links as button group, e.g. for your Social Media Accounts

LinkPageForRSS connects with a custom RSS feed (you may provide it with your existing website).

Go to /links.php and change var feed to your custom RSS feed URL.

You can change the displayed Title and infotext via settings at /config

LinkPageForRSS uses Bootstrap 5.0 delivered via CDN. You can host Bootstrap local tho.
